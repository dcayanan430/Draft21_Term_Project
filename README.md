# Draft21_Term_Project
This is an Interactive, Interchangeable Dog Treat Puzzle!
My project for this class consisted of 10 total parts, 3 sub-assemblies, and 4 assembly configurations.
I was inspired to make this because my own dog is too smart for his own good. Tricks and obedience alone will not satisfy him, so why not make hm a challenge to earn his treats.
I 3D printed these parts myself but did it in a half scale of my inital design to make printing possible.
